# Analyses and recommendations

* Employees working in software field have the highest attrition count(164) followed by sales(128). 

* The company should focus on the competetive salary based on the market trends so that the attrition for software and sales can be minimized.

* Employees between 20-30 age groups have the highest attrition count(409).

* The company should do the additional research regarding the reason for the age group of 20-30 leaving and find the effective measure to bring down the attrition.

* Top 10 subdepartments with the attrition count having technical support at the highest.

* Since the technical support and software development sub departments have the highest attrition so competetive salary and benefits can be the measures to reduce the attrition. Besides additional survey can be done by the company to know the root causes on employees leaving mostly in technical support and software development sub departments.

* Individual contributors have the highest attribution(602) followed by team lead(137) in terms of job level.

* As the attrition for individual contributors are very high in comparision to team lead and team manager, the company should focus or do research on job level and understand the cause for the attrition.
